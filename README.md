# Why I’m Learning LeetCode 75 After 5 Years in IT?

As an infrastructure engineer, I don’t write much code day‑to‑day—I mostly work with Linux to manage servers. With limited time, I want to learn effectively and focus on what matters. My goals are:

-  Cover key DSA patterns

-  Build strong fundamentals and progress from easy to medium problems

-  Improve my confidence in coding and problem‑solving

-  Learn efficiently using a curated set of LeetCode questions

-  Apply coding skills to real projects like disaster‑response systems and server automation

-  Challenge myself and enjoy learning outside my comfort zone
